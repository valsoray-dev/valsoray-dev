# valsoray-dev

The source code of my website, which uses [HTMX](https://github.com/bigskysoftware/htmx) to create a so-called internet joke.

All this works thanks to [actix-web](https://github.com/actix/actix-web) and the [Rust programming language](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust).

Therefore, not a single line of JavaScript is used in this project. (TypeScript is good, btw)
